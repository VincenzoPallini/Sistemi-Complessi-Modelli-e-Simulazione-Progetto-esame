# Evacuation simulation in emergency cases.

This project focuses on the simulation and analysis of evacuation processes in various building structures. The main objective is to understand how people move and interact during an evacuation, and how various factors, such as the arrangement of obstacles, can affect the efficiency of the evacuation.
The project uses an agent-based simulation model, in which each agent represents a person involved in the evacuation. The model uses a two-dimensional grid to represent the room, with each cell being either occupied or unoccupied. Agents move around the grid according to a set of rules and strategies, trying to get out of the room as quickly as possible 
An important part of the project is to analyze the effect of obstacles on evacuation speed. Preliminary results suggest that strategic arrangement of obstacles can have a positive effect, reducing evacuation time by 10 percent. However, an excess of obstacles can have the opposite effect, increasing evacuation times by 32.7%
